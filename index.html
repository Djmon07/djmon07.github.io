            Hello my name is Daniel Monville, I am 20 years old,
            and currently a student at Thaddeus Stevens. Currently I am taking courses
            on computer software engineering technology, and intend to pursue that as my
            career.

        <p class="persona_2">
        I currently live in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and have been here my entire life.
        I went to Lampeter-Strasburg school district growing up, and I graduated
        in 2018. I went to HACC for a year for General Education
        before transferring to Thaddeus Stevens. During that time I worked at an
        amusement park, but more about that below.

          <p class="Music">I have been interested in music for a long time. In the past I played the violin, and some guitar
            yet did not practice enough to be great at either. Currently I am interested in vocals, such as
            singing/beatboxing. </p>

        <div class="Hob_Amus">
          <h3 class="Amus_Park">Amusement Parks</h3>
          <p>I have always been interested in amusement parts more specifically thrill rides.
            Roller coasters are my main interest ,and the differences between the different types.
            For example, Some of the more well known are wooden, steel, wild mouse, and hanging coaster.
            I have also ran a few coasters when working at the amusement park in the past as a ride operator.
            Due to this I understand the safty behind coasters, and a better understand of how they opereate.
            In the future I plan to travil to ride some of the unique, or highly rated coasters.
